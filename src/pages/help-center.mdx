## Frequently Asked Questions

<hr />

#### Program Eligibility

<Collapsible title="What is the MedGrocer Wellness Program?">

MedGrocer offers its Mental Health Program to corporate clients to augment their mental health initiatives for their employees. Under the Program, you can engage with mental health professionals via teleconsults on a 24/7 appointment-based schedule. Depending on MedGrocer’s arrangements with your employer, the Program may also include wellness surveys, lectures, periodic check-ups, medicine delivery, and other services.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Can I use the services offered under the Program?">

Active employees of MedGrocer’s corporate clients are generally eligible for the Program, subject to the terms and conditions of the service contract entered into. You will know you are eligible if you received notice from your employer about the existence of the Program.

We may check your eligibility at any time by asking for certain information such as but not limited to employee ID or work email.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Until when can I avail of the  services?">

The Program and its services are co-terminus with a service contract entered into between MedGrocer and your employer. Please check with your HR or send us an email to inquire about when the services will end.

<Collapsible title="Can I transfer eligibility to another person?">

</Collapsible>

#### Teleconsultations

<Collapsible title="What are teleconsultations?">

Teleconsultations are one-on-one sessions between you and your assigned mental health professional, a licensed clinical psychologist, much like an in-person consultation. They take place via online video call, which means you can take the teleconsultation during your preferred schedule and from your preferred location.

In teleconsultations, mental health professionals walk you through any concerns you may have regarding your mental health. It’s worth noting that you may want to talk to someone even if you are healthy and have no issue at all. The mental health professionals will assess your situation and provide advice and next steps.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How do I schedule a teleconsultation?">

Please accomplish the form on the <Link to="/">booking website</Link> to book a teleconsultation. A proposed schedule will be emailed to you with a calendar invite; please respond within12 hours to confirm your slot.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="When can teleconsultations be scheduled?">

Upon booking, you will be asked what your preferred schedule is. Teleconsultation schedules are available 24/7, subject to slot availability.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Where and how can I take the teleconsultations?">

You may take your teleconsultations at the office or from home, subject to your employer’s guidelines.

On the date and time of your consultation, open the calendar invite and click the Google Meet link to start your session. You will need stable internet connection and a desktop or laptop with webcam and microphone or a smartphone with a camera.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="I don’t have access to a stable internet connection, or don’t have the equipment to get into a video call. Can I still book a teleconsultation?">

We highly encourage you to secure stable internet connection and equipment to get into a video call, so that the teleconsultation can take place via Google Meet. This is to make sure that your experience is as close as possible to an in-person consultation and that your data is secure.

However, if you really do not have access to these, you may still request for a teleconsultation through alternative channels. This will be evaluated on a case-to-case basis by the MedGrocer team and we will guide you on which channel we will be using.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="I already consult a mental health professional regularly. Can I still go on sessions with MedGrocer’s mental health professionals?">

Yes, you may still request to go on teleconsultation sessions even if you are currently seeing another mental health professional.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Will I be able to select my mental health professional? ">

Your case goes through a triage process based on your personal situation, and your preferred schedule. You will be assigned a mental health professional that best suits your needs. For follow-up sessions, you may request to talk to a different mental health professional if this is your preference for any reason.

</Collapsible>

#### Rescheduling

<Collapsible title="Can I reschedule a teleconsultation?">

If you were sent a suggested schedule, and you have yet to confirm, you may choose to reschedule by replying to the email with your preferred schedule.

If you have already confirmed your appointment schedule but cannot make it, please inform us by replying to the email trail. We will propose a new schedule, which may not necessarily be close to your original schedule.

Please note that we may augment your eligibility to the Program for repeatedly rescheduling teleconsultations.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="What if I am late to or miss my scheduled appointment?">

Your assigned mental health professional will try to reach you and will wait for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the session will be canceled. You will receive an email on the rescheduled date.

Please note that we may retract your eligibility to the Program for repeatedly being late to or missing your appointments.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="What if the mental health professional is late to or misses my scheduled appointment?">

Your assigned mental health professional may be late to your appointment if they are handling an emergency case or if their previous teleconsultation has not yet finished. Please wait for 15 minutes -- if after 15 minutes your session has not yet started, it is safe to leave. You will receive an email on the rescheduled date, which will be prioritized over other non-emergency appointments.

Please feel free to provide feedback regarding such instances through the post-consultation feedback form. This will be confidential and its results will not be seen by your mental health professional.

</Collapsible>

#### Feedback

<Collapsible title="How do I provide feedback?">

After each session, you will be sent a post-consultation feedback form. This will be confidential and its results will not be seen by your mental health professional. It will be reviewed directly by MedGrocer supervisors; we welcome both positive and negative feedback for our review and appropriate action.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="I liked how my assigned mental health professional conducted my session. Will I be assigned to them for my follow-up teleconsultations?">

Yes. By default, follow-up sessions are scheduled with the same mental health professional for continuity of care. Please feel free to provide feedback on how your session went through the post-consultation feedback form.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="I did not like how my assigned mental health professional conducted my session. Can I be assigned to a different one for my follow-up teleconsultations?">

Yes. You may request to talk to a different mental health professional if this is your preference for any reason. Even if your mental health professional conducted your session well, you can still request to talk to someone else. It is important that you are comfortable during your sessions; some people, for example, prefer talking to someone of the same gender.

Please provide feedback on how your session went through the post-consultation feedback form and do not hesitate to explicitly request to to talk to a different mental health professional for future sessions. This will be confidential and its results will not be seen by your mental health professional.

#### Emergencies and Other Questions

The teleconsult booking process is not suited for emergency situations. If you need urgent help, please reach out to your HR department -- they will be able to activate our emergency handling processes. You do not need to share the specifics of your situation with HR if you are not comfortable doing so; you may simply ask to trigger emergency procedures.

</Collapsible>

No. As long as you are eligible based on the parameters described above, the service is free for you. We may check your eligibility at any time by asking for certain information such as but not limited to employee ID or work email.

</Collapsible>

You may not be able to avail of the services under the Program only in the following circumstances:

A. If the Program has ended

B. If you are not eligible

C. If you were previously eligible but your eligibility was revoked

The Program is designed to create a positive environment for everyone’s mental wellbeing. We may revoke your eligibility if there are intentional and recurring efforts on your part to disrupt this, such as but not limited to: abusing the services, missing teleconsultations, harassing mental health professionals, suggesting that mental health professionals engage in unethical or illegal acts, and unreasonably triggering emergency processes.
